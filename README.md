Venmo-type payment system that allows you to send and request money from other users

**Implementation**


Built a CLI app in C# leveraging APIs with ASP.NET Core MVC & a database with MS SQL Server.


**Steps Involved**
- Created database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Built out corresponding models in Visual Studio with a DAO pattern
- Put to test my API knowledge from bootcamp by following an MVC pattern to make API calls

**Future Steps**

- Work out some bugs which cause the app to crash
- Build this out as a front-end web app
